### A Passion Project By Brian Marshall

---

This was a solo project undertaken as a student at General Assembly's
Web Development Immersive Program from Feb - May, 2016.

Technologies Used:

  * Javascript
  * HTML5
  * CSS3
  * jQuery
  * Materialize
  * Wavepad (licenced version)

The sources of these mp3 clips are from the public domain and include interviews and public
speeches.  

This API does not (yet) work on mobile devices, but I'm investigating that option.

The biggest challenge was creating the player, and was the first time I worked with callback
functions (18 of them in a row!) in any serious depth.

This is the second version, for which I first developed a script, THEN created the player, which was a big improvement for continuity.  This was a massive undertaking, given the amount of audio I had to listen to/tolerate.
